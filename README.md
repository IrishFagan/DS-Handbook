# My Data Structures Handbook

by Michael Fagan

This is a summary of the data structures I have mastered. I created this handbook to
display that not only can I implement many data structures, but that I also understand 
these structures and why you should use certain structures in certain situations.

## The List

* [Array](array.md)
* [Stack](stack.md)
* [Linked List](linkedlist.md)
* [Set](set.md)
* [Tuple](tuple.md)
* [Dictionary](dictionary.md)
* [Binary Search Tree](bst.md)
* [AVL Tree](avltree.md)
* [Hash Table](hashtable.md)
* [Graph](graph.md)
* [Binary Heap](binaryheap.md)
* [Queue](queue.md)
* [Deque](deque.md)
