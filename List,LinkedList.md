# List/Linked List

**List**: Essentially seen as a dynamic array, which can dynamically change it's size depending on whether or not values are being removed or added.

**Linked List**: A linked list is composed of nodes that when continuously pointed towards the next node creates a list, which is therefore considered a linked list.
