# Graph

A graph is similar to a tree in that it has nodes and edges. Although, a graph does have edges with weights and can have multiple edges connecting to other vertices.

# In Memory

In memory, a graph looks like this:

# Operations

A Graph supports the following operations:

* **Insertion(Vertex)**: Inserts a vertex into the graph.
  * O(1), constant time.

* **Insertion(Edge)**: Inserts an edge, connecting two provided vertices.
  * O(1), constant time.

* **Deletion(Vertex)**: Deletes a vertex, which in hand disconnects edges.
  * O(|E|).
  
* **Deletion(Edge)**: Deletes an edge that was connected between two vertices.
  * O(|V|).

# Use Cases
